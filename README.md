- 👋 Hi, I’m @DanMolenhouse, a Master of Information Systems Management student at Carnegie Mellon University.
- The core MISM program focuses on technical and leadership skills in technology, so I concentrated my electives on my passion: cybersecurity. Atypical to most MISM students, I have taken courses like Ethical Penetration Testing, Data-focused Python, and Privacy in the Digital Age to expand my cybersecurity and privacy knowledge.
- Studying at the [#1 school in both Information and Technology Management and Cybersecurity](https://www.heinz.cmu.edu/about/rankings) was very important to me because my background and undergraduate studies were in Mechanical Engineering, so I knew I needed to be in an environment where learning is paramount.
